# Internations Users & Groups
Thank you for this opportunity.  I hope you find this project interesting and I look forward to discussing it with you.

## Quick Start
1) npm install
2) npm run database
3) (new terminal window) npm start
4) (new terminal window) open index.html

## Organization
The code and file structure is organized according to my presentation on the topic: [9 Tips for a clean backbonejs app](http://slides.com/adamterlson/9-tips-for-a-clean-backbonejs-app#/).

##Tests
I'd be happy to discuss unit testing approaches, I have a lot to say on the matter.  I however excluded tests from this project in the interest of time.

## ES6 + Backbone
This was my first opportunity to combine Backbone with ES6.  It was fun to learn something new here and to adapt my old strategies into a more ES6-y way of doing things.
